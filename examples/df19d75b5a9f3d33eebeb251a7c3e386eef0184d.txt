Here she had been but a short while,
\Vhen one afternoon she met
The object of her attcctions,
Mr. Byrd, the handsome cadet.
From the ﬁrst. she knew she loved him,
All thoughts of Jack had fled;
The love she once had for him,
\\'as now both cold and dead.
Now she thinks of him only
As a friend of former days;
She truly loves her soldier,
And ever sings his praise.
And today she loves him dearly,
And she says she will forever;
Although his love for her may change,
_ Heaven knows that hers will never.
—Miriam Atkinson.
EARLY PAINTING.
Lula Carter.
The history of painting is as old as the Pyramids.
The Egyptians boasted that they had invented painting
six thousand years before it passed into Greece. The ear-
liest pictures among all nations were outlined ﬁgures traced
in proﬁle, on the walls of temples and tombs. These ﬁgures
were probably sketched with a reed or brush in red and
black and ﬁlled in with a ﬂat tint. The ﬁrst su.bj‘ec‘ts were
battles and hunting scenes descriptive of the life and cus-
toms of the people. _
Tn the Egyptian collections preserved in museums, the
paintings upon the mummy cloths are still fresh and bright.
The painting of vases and statues seems to have been
the early use of color among the Greeks. After the Peeopon-
nesian war the city of Ephesus became the center of art.
Parrhasius and Zeuxis were the master painters. It was one
of them who painted grapes at which the birds picked. The
other painted a curtain so well as to deceive his rival him-
self. -
The Romans were not of much talent, but were liberal
patrons of Greek art. julius Caesar is said to have paid two
hundred thousand dollars for two pictures. Nero order-
ed a portrait of himself on a canvas one hundred and twenty
feet high. This painting was afterwards destroyed by light-
ning.
