THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF C.l.C. IN LANCHOW
The dumb-bell shaped province of Kansu stretches from China’s north-
west towards Sinkiang, or Chinese Turkestan. The neck of this huge dumb-
bell is probably the most fertile part, being a high plateau some 5,000 feet above
‘sea level, well watered by the Yellow River. Immediately below the neck and in
the middle of the province is the city of Lanchow, the provincial capital. This
is now the C.I.C.'s most northwesterly depot. The main products of -Lanchow
are in the textile, leather and fur industries, but the district is a vital source of
raw materials for the whole northwest region.
Raw wool comes to Lanchow on camels from Inner Mongolia, or on sheep-
skin rafts down the Yellow River from Chinghai (Kokonorx) During the past
winter 670,000 lbs. of wool was made into army blankets on the spot, while
another 800,000 lbs. was freighted down the International Highway to C.l.C.
Depots in South Kansu, Paochi and Sian—in South Shensi Province. Coop
