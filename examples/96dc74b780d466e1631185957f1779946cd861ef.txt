TOAST TO JUNIORS.
Here’s to Ida,
Our president dear,
May she soon learn to laugh right
And say “no” instead of “ne-ow."
lleres to Lena,
At home she likes to stay,
She wrote to us, ‘Tm awfully ill,”
But what does the §ociety page say?
Here's to Martha,
Latin odes she'll never lack,
We always know she's coming
VVhen we hear her “quack-quacl<-quack.”
Here's to Lollie,
She's awfully jolly,
But to write a German exercise,
She seems to think is folly.
Here‘s to _l. ll. Mac,
Such a tiny little lass, (P)
She never cuts a lesson
An<l's the l>rightest of her class.
llere's to Lizzie (iarner,
In “'l‘rig"’ she raised a fuss,
Because she's not allowed to say
“l say" and “It was thus.”
llere's to l7r:1nces_
The smallest in the class,
lint when it comes to reading Latin
.\ll the _lunior.< she'll surpass,
Here's to a girl
Vlhose name is julia Purser,
5he's a preacher’s daughter.
And. of course_ she can't he worser.
Here's to Lyllian
The love of all, she’s won,
Because you see sl1e's always
just brimming o'er with fun,
—Miriam Madden.
Here’s to Miriam Madden!

.VVe toil on in these classic halls,
Our goal the full A. B. degree-—
We heed not pleasure’s siren calls,
Our ardous duties all vi/e see,
Sophomores strive to imitate us,
Seniors can’t intimidate us,
Freshmen plcdgﬁ allegiance true’
