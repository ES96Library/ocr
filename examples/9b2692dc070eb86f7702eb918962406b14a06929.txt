will support the father, mother, three or four brothers and
their families.
The reason for prefering a boy is socia-religious, be-
cause of the continuance of an unbroken line. The Chinese
have much the same feeling as the Hebrews in that respect.
If there are no male heirs a family will often adopt a boy.
The religious side is also very strong The most vital part
of their religion is the worship of the ancestors, which can
only be carried on by the male heirs.
One good old woman told of how she strangled six baby
girls, one after the other, because of their poverty, and yet
she loved them so well that she dared not look at them,
for fear her heart would relent. When she became a Chris-
tian she repented, and yet she did what she thought was
best, Because so many girls are thus disposed of, China,
contrary to the condition in most countries, has more men
than women.
The little girl is very free and happy the ﬁrst few years
of her life. She plays in the streets with the other little boys
and girls and is petted by everyone. But at about ﬁve the
burdens of life descend upon her. Her tender little feet are
bound and cramped to the conventional shape, so that she is
forced to hobble all her life. We think this very cruel, and
it is, but let us not judge them too harshly. The custom has
held for hundreds of years; they look for nothingelse.
There are several reasons given by tradition for this
custom of foot-binding. Some say that it came simply from
the desire to keep the girls from roaming the streets. There
is, however, a more romantic explanation- According to the
old legend the emperor’s favorite wife, though very beauti-
ful, had a deformed foot. This was a source of great trial to
her. So the emperor, to comfort her, ordered every woman
in the kingdom to deform her feet likewise.
This barbarous practice does not hold among the Man-
chus, who conquered China several hundred years ago. As
a sign of subjugation they ordered the Chinese to adopt
their style of dress. V\/hereas the men had before worn
their hair on top of their heads they now braided it down
their backs. But the women ﬂatly refused to unbind their
feet. The Manchu and Chinese men now dress alike, but
the women in a totally different style. One old Chinaman
expressed it well when he said, “The men were conquered,
but the women _nev_er.” However, what the Manchus could
not do Christianity is doing.

PURPOSE OF MAGAZINE.
There is a conscious or unconscious purpose in all manifesta-
tions of energy. Our magazine too has a purpose, a three-fold one.
First, we would like to acquaint the world with the fact of our ex-
istence, and that we are doing things, and striving to do more. Sec-
ondly, we need a medium through which to express our activities;
mental, social, and religious. There is no political body, no relig-
ious organization worth the name, no educational movement, without
its organ. If there is a poet in our midst, it is our purpose that she
shall not “ waste her sweetness on the desert air,” or lie in death
“a mute inglorious Milton.” Last, but not least, the paper is to
stimulate literary activity, and urge us on to greater things—who
knows but that there may be amongus some embryo author who
shall one day rival George Eliot or Elizabeth Barrett Browning,
who but for her efforts on this paper might never have undertaken
literary work.
COLLEGE SPIRIT.
We are happy to be able to say that the session of I907-’o8 has
opened up with much more spirit than the last. But girls, we need
more. Wholesome college spirit is a thing of which we cannot get
too much. Every Cox girl down at the bottom of her heart knows
that this is the ﬁnest college at all. Now let us say it. Let us say
it in the way we study, and in the way we play. Let us individually,
determine to be beaten by no one, and to graduate with the highest
