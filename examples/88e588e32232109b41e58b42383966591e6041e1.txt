What’s the matter
When your heart goes pit-a-pat,
And you crush your old felt hat,
Or you buy a newcravat?
You’re in love.
VVhen you’re always in a hurry,
With your heart strings in a ﬂurry,
And the other boys don't worry?
You’re engaged.
When you work the whole day through,
And there’s always work to do,
Yet you say that life is true?
You’re married now. —Exchange.

Money talks
As we have heard tell,
And to most of us
It says, Farewell.
A man’s high ambition
Is never complete
Till he has accomplished
A very great feat.
Not so with a woman,
Who likes to be sweet,
For she is contented
With very small feet. —Exchange.
Caesar sic dicat un di cur eyressi lictum. Freshman
translation: Caesar sieked the cat on the cur; I guess he
licked him.—Exchange.
Up at seven
For breakfast forage;
Saw-dust food,
Eggs from cold storage.
Corn in cans,
And old tomatoes;
Shrivelled peas
And sad potatoes.
Doubtful beef,
Tough ham and biscuit;
Custard-pie,
But who would risk it? -—-Exchange.
