“I'm a resource person, shall we say. People
come to talk to me. Yesterday there was an
editor from the Philadelphia Enquirer
who’s going to China in a month or two.
And a student came this afternoon. So there
is something valuahle I can do, still. I think
it’s terribly important that people know
something about old China. Because China
didn’t just jump out of _lo\'e’s head like
Minerva. New China comes out of old
China~not only the sufferings of old China,
but its structure and the determination of
the people to live as well as possible.”
Ida Pruitt, 88 years old, one of the found-
ing memhers of the Philadelphia USCPFA,
actively encourages friendship hetween the
Chinese and American people by sharing
the knowledge she has accumulated in a
lifetime of hridging the two cultures.
Daughter of one of the earliest missionary
families in China, Ms. Pruitt was born in
Penglai, Shantung Province, on the North
China sea coast. I-Ier father, a Baptist from
Georgia, spent most of his time in China
studying and translating. Her mother, from
